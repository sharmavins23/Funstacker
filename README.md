# Funstacker

This project houses a beginner Racket tutorial follow-along on
[Funstacker.](https://beautifulracket.com/funstacker)

The project builds upon [the previous](https://github.com/sharmavins23/Stacker/)
postfix stack-based calculator compiler by rewriting the stack-based
functionality into a functional-oriented form.

## How to use

Modify the lines underneath the `#lang` line in `stacker-test.rkt` with the
expected postfix expression. Each value or operator should be on a new line.

Make sure to modify the comments with the current expression too, in order to
cross-reference the answer.
